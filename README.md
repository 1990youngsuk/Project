I created a responsive website that shows 'My Life'

In the website, it has a nav bar of total 4 functions: Contact number, YouTube, Gallery, and MAps.
If you click Contact number, it shows an alert saying my personal phone number and Email address.
If you click YouTube, it automatically links you to my YouTube channel where I upload my songs which are recorded whenever I went to Karaoke(Yes, I like to sing)
IF you click Gallery, it shows my photos from Onedrive.
By clicking Maps, You will be able to see where I live (But because I used development purpose API from Google, it doesn't show the whole world saying 'Development purposes only')
For 'Maps', I used Google API and JavaScript, and when you click it, it shows and hides the Google map.

And also there are icons of Facebook and Instagram, which also lead to my account of those.

Down below, I posted a cool picture I took when I was taking a pilot course with a box that enables you to send an ID and type of contact: Email, Facebook, and Instagram.
The ID box is a input box of 'type' and type of contact box is 'dropdown box'.

Then the website has 8 total pictures with responsive size.

Because the purpose of the website was to make it responsive, if you shrink or resize the web, it rearranges the arrangement and prioritizes the efficiency of display.
I was able to do this by using media query.

If the display shirnks down below 768 pixels, it hides nav bar and instead a so-to-speak hamburger bar button appears. If you click the button, it shows main functions and icons.

Thank you.
